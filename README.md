LicenceProjectWindows8
======================

Application Windows 8 made on licence project, by [Nicolas BASCON](https://github.com/nicobascon) and [Yannis RICHARD](https://github.com/yannisrichard).
 
Proposed by [Sebastien SALVA](http://sebastien.salva.free.fr/), we had to create  a Windows 8 application to manage administration part in a teacher-searcher like website. We had to use the web services we created before, [here](https://github.com/YearDegree2/LicenceProject).

When we created the application, the web services we created before were on our WampServer. So our Windows 8 application use http://localhost/LicenceProject/web at the beginning of each request. Because we know it's useful to can change this just one time for all the application, in the file variable.js in the folder LicenceProjectWindows8/js you just have to modify the beginAddress variable and this will work.
